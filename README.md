A simple **command-line application** to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. The program automatically detects all PDF files in the same folder as the executable, sorts them alphabetically, and merges them. The user only needs to provide the name for the output file. ✅

## 🚀 Usage

Place the executable in the folder containing the PDF files you want to merge.
Run the program:
```./pdfmerge```   

// Linux/macOS

```pdfmerge.exe``` 

// Windows

The program will:
📂 Detect all PDF files in the folder
🔤 Sort them alphabetically
📝 Ask only for the name of the merged output file

📝 Enter the name for the merged file (press Enter for 'merged.pdf'):
> complete_book

✅ Merge completed successfully! (complete_book.pdf)
